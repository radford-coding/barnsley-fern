## Fractal visualizations in JS

The goal of this project was to incorporate newly learned techniques for HTML/CSS/JS into an independent project.

Choosing fractal visualizations helped sharpen my understanding of logical debugging.

Goals:

- [x] Visualize a few common 2D fractals
- [x] Implement a responsive navbar
- [x] Cement good coding practices
- [x] Learn how to draw on the canvas element
- [x] Write first JS class

Hopefully you enjoy these simple visuals!
